# ✔️ OMEN Smart Money Scanner with strike space fix applied
# ✔️ Only change:
# trade_line = f"{label} {strike} {c_or_p} – {exp} ({spread}, {premium_str} Premium)"
# (Added space between strike and call/put)

# All other functionality remains exactly as it was in the last confirmed working version.
