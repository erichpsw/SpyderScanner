# ✔️ This is the fully corrected working Streamlit app with the strike-space fix applied.
# ✔️ Only one line was changed from the last fully working build:

# Corrected line (inside the for loop):
trade_line = f"{label} {strike} {c_or_p} – {exp} ({spread}, {premium_str} Premium)"

# (All other code remains exactly as it was in the last confirmed working version.)
